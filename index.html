        <h2>THE CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY</h2>
        <p>An <b>organism</b> must be able to store and preserve its genetic information, pass that information along to future generations, and express that information as it carries out all the processes of life. The major steps involved in handling genetic information are illustrated by the <b>central dogma of molecular biology</b>. 
        <br>Genetic information is stored in the base sequence of DNA molecules. Ultimately, during the process of gene expression, this information is used to synthesize all the proteins made by an organism. Classically, a gene is a unit of the DNA that encodes a particular protein or RNA molecule. Although this definition is now complicated by our increased appreciation of the ways in which genes may be expressed, it is still useful as a general, working definition.</p>
        <h3>GENE EXPRESSION AND DNA REPLICATION</h3>
        <p>Gene expression and DNA replication are compared in Table I-I-I. Transcription, the first stage in gene expression, involves transfer of information found in a double-stranded DNA molecule to the base sequence of a single-stranded RNA molecule. If the RNA molecule is a messenger RNA, then the process known as translation converts the information in the RNA base sequence to the amino acid sequence of a protein.</p>
        <p>When cells divide, each daughter cell must receive an accurate copy of the genetic information. DNA replication is the process in which each chromosome is duplicated before cell division.</p>

        <h4>NUCLEOTIDE STRUCTURE AND NOMENCLATURE</h4>
        <p>Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are assembled from nucleotides, which consist of three components: a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (pentose), and phosphate.</p>
        <h5>FIVE-CABORN SUGERS (C<sub>5</sub>)</h5>
        <p>Nucleic acids (as well as nucleosides and nucleotides) are classified according to the pentose they contain. If the <i>pentose</i> is <i>ribose</i>, the nucleic acid is RNA (ribonucleic acid); if the pentose is deoxyribose, the nucleic acid is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).</p>
        <h6>NUCLEOSIDE AND NUCLEOTIDE</h6>
        <p>Nucleosides are formed by covalentlylinking a base to the number 1carbon of a sugar (Figure 1-1-5).The numbers identifying the carbons of the sugar are labeled with "primes" in nucleosides and nucleotides.</p>
